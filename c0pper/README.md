# ðŸš¨ copper 
<a href = "https://gmiesner.github.io/copper/">copper</a> is an application that holds officers accountable for their behavior through ratings in order to minimize unnccesary conflict with civilians. copper was built collaboratively for the <a href = "https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/3480-notuniversity-hacks" target = "_blank">NotUniversity Hacks</a> hackathon. copper has four main features: search, rate, list, and map. the search feature allows the user to search for an officer based on their badge number and precinct. the rate feature allows the user to rate their interaction with the officer; this feature captures the badge number, the city the incident occurred in, a rating of friendliness from 1 - 5, a description of the incident, and optional uploading of a picture of the officer's badge if the user was able to capture it. additionally, the lack of a log-in feature is to protect the anonymity of the civilian reporter and decrease the likelihood of any retaliation by those unhappy with how they rated a particular officer.

# ðŸ”¨ how copper was built 
together, we brainstormed Copper over discord and began to design it collaboratively in adobe XD; later also allocating tasks, coding together, and debugging by communicating via discord. we built copper using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery in visual studio code for the front end and we used Python and Flask for the back end, and pushed our code to GitHub to bring the web application together.
