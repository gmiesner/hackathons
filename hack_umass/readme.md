# ðŸ©º healthX
healthX is a web application that was created for the <a href = "https://hackumass.com/">hack umass hackathon</a> during the december 18th- 20th weekend. healthX was created by samson dsouza, gabriella miesner, kirubel moges, and casey ryan. 

healthX takes your health data from a fitbit or other wearable fitness device along with data that you input, such as water consumption and gives you statistics to show you how you are doing. the main dashboard gives you an overall health score as well as how that health score is compared to the worldwide healthX users, amount of water you consumed today as well as comparative statistics, your step count as well as comparative statistics, your mile count as well as comparative statistics, last night's hours of sleep as well as comparative statistics, your blood pressure as well as comparative statistics, and your average heart rate as well as comparative statistics. 

the individual statistic pages give you more indepth information on that biometric, including a histogram that shows the distribution of healthX user's statistics, an explanation of where you stand, and more information on how to improve that particular statistic, if you are in need of help with it. 

there is also a health help page, that gives you articles on how to improve certain aspects of your health, as well as show you where your health is doing well.
