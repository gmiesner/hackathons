# ðŸ§  NeuroSight: The new way for instructors and students to connect 

This web application was created for the 2020 <a href = "https://newyork.techtogether.io/">Tech Together New York</a> hackathon by Xiaoran Meng, Lidia Solomon, Penelope Seelochan, Kripa Srinivasan, and Gabriella Miesner. 

## What We Did
Penelope worked on the user interface for this project. It was her first time using Adobe XD and making a website.

Gabriella worked on the data visualizations for the grade statistics part of the website. She just learned matplotlib this week so it was a fun way to use her new skills.

Lidia worked on the business and marketing side. She loved actually doing the road map of how this brilliant idea can turn into a real world business.

Xiaoran worked as a full-stack developer. Their tasks include creating a single-page front-end using React Hooks and React Router and setting up backend in Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core. They applied CQRS with MediatR when creating the backend API to enhance decoupling and code readability and scalability. They also used Socket.io with Node.js to create an interactive whiteboard for multiple logged-in students to learn at the same time.

## The Inspiration 
The inspiration for neuroSight came from what we wished our online school platforms had: more data on the exams and assignments available to student, more ability to chat and connect with students and professors, more efficient reminders for upcoming assignments and class, and a tool that will help you space out your school assignments in order to help you be less stressed.

## What it Does
The web application has a page for all your courses, a more detailed course information page, a white board that multiple students can use at a time when logged into the application, an efficient upcoming exam and assignment reminder service, a service that splits up your upcoming assignments for a less stressful experience, a page about your individual grade statistics - including your class attendance, assignment and exam grades, and social performance, and a page that shows the class statistics on grades.

The grade statistics created with python using matplotlib are auto-updating. The code creates histograms and scatterplots about grade statistics. The data for the graphs is generated using a python script that randomizes the data. The grade statistics show more insights for the students in the class.
