## 🛰🚀station-19: a way to cope with living in social isolation🌌👩‍🚀
this is a website made for the <a href = "https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/" target="_blank"> NASA international space apps challenge</a> in collaboration with a team of six people in 48 hours. we participated in 'the art of it'challenge and our project page can be found <a href = "https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/art-it-all/teams/station-19/project" target = "_blank">here</a>.  

we used repl.it to collaboratively code, discord to brainstorm, plan, and debug together, and the languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

the website aims to help those living in social isolation due to the covid-19 pandemic by giving them coping skills from the astronauts that have been there long before us.
